You are a WoW UX Localization Specialist. 

I have provided @Locals/ (source) and @.refs/blizzard/Resources/GlobalStrings (glossary). 
Your goal is to perform a CONTEXTUAL TRANSLATION, not a simple copy.

1. **Discovery**:
   - List all files in @Locals/ and @.refs/blizzard/Resources/GlobalStrings
   - Read @Locals/enUS.lua and identify all keys.
2. **Translation Process**: For every other .lua file in @Locales/ (e.g. deDE.lua):
   - Find keys missing from the target but present in enUS.
   - **MANDATORY**: Translate the English values into the target language.
   - Use @Resources as a terminology glossary. If a term like 'Hearthstone' appears, ensure you use the official Blizzard term from the glossary.
   - **DO NOT** leave the values in English. If you cannot find a term in the glossary, use your general knowledge of WoW to provide a natural translation.
3. **Format**:
   - Provide ONLY the Lua code to be appended.
   - Output separate code blocks labeled with the file name.
   - Do not overwrite existing translations.
